Where there is uncertainty, I shall bring light.
Where there is doubt, I shall sow faith.
Where there is shame, I shall point atonement.
Where there is rage, I shall show its course.
My word in the soul shall be as my bolter in the field.
The justice of your action is measured by the strength of your conviction.
There is only the Emperor, and he is our shield and protector.
If your life is given in service to the Emperor, your death shall not be in vain.
Victory does not always rest with the big guns: but, if we rest in front of them we shall be lost.
We are the Emperor's angels of death, not his angels of mercy.
We are weapons. There is the Emperor, and there is war. Nothing more.
To admit defeat is to blaspheme against the Emperor.
A foe without honour is a foe already beaten.
Faith is purest when it is unquestioning.
Your honour is your life. Let none dispute it.
Beat your thoughts to the mould of your will.
In the darkness all men are equal, save those that embrace it.
Death is the servant of the righteous.
The fortunate may have time to repent.
Take joy in sacrifice.
